                Description: <br><br><br>
                <u>Release Date: April 16, 1988</u> <br>
                <u>Director: Hayao Miyazaki</u> <br>
                <u>Screenplay: Hayao Miyazaki</u> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
                    The video opens with a prologue showing a futuristic city skyline and a group of scientists working in a lab. They are monitoring a huge, glowing egg that is suspended in the air. Suddenly, the egg hatches and a young girl emerges from inside. She is immediately pursued by a group of men in white suits, who chase her through the city streets.
                As the girl flees, she is rescued by two angels who swoop down from the sky on a flying motorcycle. The angels take the girl to their hidden underground lair, where they care for her and try to help her recover from her ordeal.
                As the girl begins to settle in with her new caretakers, the angels reveal that they have a mission to rescue people who are suffering in the world above. They show the girl a map of the city, which is covered in a dense fog that is caused by pollution and other environmental disasters. The angels explain that their job is to bring hope and light to the people who live in the city, and to help them believe in a better future.
                The angels take the girl on a wild ride through the city, showing her the sights and sounds of the world above. They show her a concert by Chage & Aska, where the crowd is singing along to their music with joy and abandon. The girl is mesmerized by the energy and excitement of the concert, and begins to feel a sense of hope and possibility.
                However, the girl is haunted by memories of the cult that held her captive. She is afraid to trust anyone, and is constantly looking over her shoulder for danger. As the angels continue their mission to help the people of the city, the girl struggles to reconcile her past with her new life.
                The climax of the video takes place at a massive dam that has been built to control the flow of water in the city. The angels are racing to stop the dam from collapsing, as the pressure from the water builds to dangerous levels. The girl, too afraid to face the danger, stays behind in the underground lair.
                In the end, the angels are successful in stopping the dam from collapsing, and the city is saved from disaster. The girl, inspired by the angels' bravery, emerges from the underground lair and joins them in the world above. The video ends with a shot of the girl, the angels, and the people of the city all singing and dancing together in a celebration of hope and unity.
