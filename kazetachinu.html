                    The film is set in Japan during the early 20th century, a time of great social and technological change. Jiro Horikoshi is a young boy who dreams of designing and flying planes. Despite his poor eyesight, Jiro's passion and determination lead him to study aeronautical engineering.
                    As he grows older, Jiro becomes an accomplished engineer and is recruited to work on Japan's fighter planes during World War II. However, his work on the planes is not without moral conflict, as he grapples with the realization that his designs will be used for war and destruction.
                    Along the way, Jiro meets and falls in love with a young woman named Nahoko, who he had encountered earlier in his dreams. Despite their differences in social class and Nahoko's poor health, they form a deep and meaningful bond.
                    As the war intensifies and Japan's defeat becomes inevitable, Jiro is forced to confront the harsh realities of his work and his country's role in the war. He struggles with his conscience as he sees the devastating consequences of his designs firsthand.
                    The film builds to a poignant and emotional climax, as Jiro is forced to confront the tragic consequences of his work and the sacrifices he has made for his country. In the end, he is left to contemplate the true cost of his passion and the weight of his own conscience.t
