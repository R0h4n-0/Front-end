            The story follows Anna Sasaki, a young girl who is sent to live with relatives in a rural seaside town to help improve her asthma. Anna is an introverted and isolated child, who often feels like she doesn't fit in with her peers. She spends much of her time drawing and writing in her sketchbook, where she can express herself freely.
     One day, while exploring the marshes near her new home, Anna meets a mysterious girl named Marnie. Marnie is kind and outgoing, and Anna is immediately drawn to her. The two girls strike up an unlikely friendship, spending afternoons together at Marnie's beautiful, abandoned mansion by the sea.
     As Anna spends more time with Marnie, she begins to uncover the secrets of the girl's past. Marnie tells Anna about her life growing up in the mansion, and how she used to sneak out at night to attend glamorous parties with her wealthy parents. However, Marnie's stories are often conflicting, and Anna begins to suspect that there is more to her new friend than meets the eye.
     Meanwhile, Anna struggles to connect with the other children in town. She is jealous of their carefree lives, and often feels like an outsider. One day, she overhears some of the kids talking about her behind her back, and she becomes convinced that she will never fit in.
     As Anna continues to unravel the mystery of Marnie's past, she begins to develop a deeper understanding of herself and her own family. She learns that Marnie's story is intertwined with her own, and that the two girls have more in common than she ever could have imagined.
     Without spoiling the ending, the plot of "When Marnie Was There" takes several twists and turns as Anna uncovers the truth about Marnie's past and learns to embrace her own identity. Along the way, the film explores themes of friendship, self-discovery, and the power of memory and imagination.
