                Description: <br><br><br>
                <u>Release Date: April 16, 1988</u> <br>
                <u>Director: Hayao Miyazaki</u> <br>

                Kiki is initially full of confidence and optimism, but soon finds that life in the city is more challenging than she anticipated. She struggles to find a place to live and work, and her attempts to use her magical powers to help people often go awry. However, she soon meets Osono, a kind-hearted baker who offers her a room in exchange for delivering her goods around town. With a newfound sense of purpose, Kiki begins her delivery service and quickly becomes a familiar sight in Koriko.
                As Kiki navigates the challenges of her new life, she grapples with issues of identity and self-doubt. She worries that she's not talented enough, and struggles to find her place in the world as a young witch. However, with the help of her friends, including Tombo, a young boy who dreams of flying, Kiki begins to discover her own unique strengths and talents.
                Despite her growing confidence, Kiki faces a major setback when she loses her magical powers. She becomes depressed and loses her sense of purpose, but with the encouragement of her friends, she eventually finds the strength to continue her work without magic. Through her perseverance and determination, Kiki proves that true magic comes from within.
